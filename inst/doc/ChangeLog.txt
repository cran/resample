Change in the resample package, most recent first.


---- 0.4    2015-04-12

Rename confidence interval functions, from limits.* to CI.*, e.g. CI.percentile.
   limits.percentile -> CI.percentile
   limits.t          -> CI.t
   limits.bootstrapT -> CI.bootstrapT

Add CI.bca.

Note website for newest versions in help(resample-package), and email
list for announcements of new versions.

Better automatically-generated statistic names.

quantile and confidence interval functions consistently return a matrix
with appropriate dimnames.

Add a tolerance for use in computing P-values from permutation tests.

Printing a permutationTest2 object now gives both sample sizes.



---- 0.3    2014-11-23

This version is for people using
"What Teachers Should Know about the Bootstrap: Resampling in the
Undergraduate Statistics Curriculum", Tim Hesterberg (2014)
  http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.5279
This version is not on CRAN, only on
  http://www.timhesterberg.net/packages
(I expect to do another release soon, and CRAN frowns on frequent releases.)

Change the default number of resamples to 10000 (9999 for permutation tests).

Change the name of the argument specifying the number of resamples from
B to R.

Remove anyNA, require R >= 3.1.0.

Confidence intervals now return probability levels as columns and different
statistics as rows.

New functions jackknife, limits.bca, limits.bootstrapT.
The current versions only support one sample.

New utility functions IfElse, cat0, cat0n, catn,
colStdevs, colVars.

Add datasets, use them in examples.

Add an expand argument to limits.percentile.

Add support for graphical bootstrap, where there is no numerical statistic.

Modify hist.resample to add a vertical line at the observed value,
add a legend, use more breaks and remove the borders of bars.
Add arguments to control the breaks and legend.

Change the default plotting character in qqnorm.resample.


---- 0.2    2014-03-10

Initial public release.
